phonegap-sms-plugin
=====================

This Android Phonegap plugin allows you to easily send SMS in android using both native SMS Manager or by invoking the default android SMS app. This plugin works with PhoneGap 3.x version.

The Android portion was forked from https://github.com/javatechig/phonegap-sms-plugin by javatechig and then modified to upgrade it to phonegap 3.0.

The iOS portion was copied from https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins by Jesse MacFadyen and then modified slightly to work with this plugin and phonegap 3.x.

Installation
=================

Using the Phonegap CLI run:

    phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/aharris88/phonegap-sms-plugin.git

This will place the plugin in your plugins directory and update your android.json file that keeps track of installed plugins.

Then when you run:

    phonegap build android

or

    phonegap install android

phonegap will put the necessary files into the platforms/android directory. It will update AndroidManifest.xml, res/xml/config.xml, and it will add the src/org/apache/cordova/sms directory.

Example Usage
=================

HTML

    <input name="" id="numberTxt" placeholder="Enter mobile number" value="" type="tel" />
    <br/>
    <textarea name="" id="messageTxt" placeholder="Enter message"></textarea>
    <br/>
    <input id="btnDefaultSMS" type="button" value="Send SMS" />

Javascript
Note that the following code uses jquery.

    var app = {
        // Application Constructor
        initialize: function() {
            this.bindEvents();
        },
        // Bind Event Listeners
        //
        // Bind any events that are required on startup. Common events are:
        // 'load', 'deviceready', 'offline', and 'online'.
        bindEvents: function() {
            document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);
        },
        // deviceready Event Handler
        //
        // The scope of 'this' is the event. In order to call the 'receivedEvent'
        // function, we must explicity call 'app.receivedEvent(...);'
        onDeviceReady: function() {
            $("#btnDefaultSMS").click(function(){
                alert("click");
                var number = $("#numberTxt").val();
                var message = $("#messageTxt").val();
                var intent = "INTENT"; //leave empty for sending sms using default intent
                var success = function () { alert('Message sent successfully'); };
                var error = function (e) { alert('Message Failed:' + e); };
                sms.send(number, message, intent, success, error);
            });
        }
    };

    BUILD FAILED

The problem is that you need to make sure that you set the target to android-19 or later in your ./platforms/android/project.properties file like this:

    # Project target.
    target=android-19

###How can I send sms in my app without passing to native app like it can be done on Android?

This isn't possible on iOS. It requires that you show the user the native sms composer, to be able to send an sms.

Contributing
=================

I believe that everything is working, feel free to put in an issue or to fork and make pull requests if you want to add a new feature.

Things you can fix:
* Allow for null number to be passed in
  Right now, it breaks when a null value is passed in for a number, but it works if it's a blank string, and allows the user to pick the number
  It should automatically convert a  null value to an empty string
